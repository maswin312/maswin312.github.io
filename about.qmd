Hi I'm Windaru, as a data analyst with 3 years of experience, I have a passion for turning raw data into insights that drive business decisions. I excel in R, Python, SQL, and Tableau, using these tools to transform complex data sets into visualizations that are accessible and understandable for stakeholders.

In my previous role as a data analyst, I was responsible for developing and maintaining automated reports and dashboards, analyzing data to identify trends and patterns, and presenting insights to senior leadership. Through this work, I gained expertise in data wrangling and data visualization.

I am a highly collaborative team player who thrives in fast-paced environments. I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in data analysis.

If you're looking for a data analyst who can deliver actionable insights that drive business growth, let's connect!
